# Relembed 

This is a repository that contains example code for one of my blog posts.

It deals with text embeddings for blog posts and updates the relevant markdown files with the paths to related posts.

It contains two parts:

1) The Python HTTP `./api` to calculate embeddings for a given text. [Readme](./api/README.md)
2) The Go `./cli` to update the related posts in markdown files for my own blog. [Readme](./cli/README.md)

This code is not production ready and only serves as an example.
